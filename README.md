# Stock Technical Indicator Analysis

## Overview

This project is a data pipeline that generates automated buy signal alerts for selected stocks and evaluates the effectiveness of technical indicators in predicting future performance. 

A buy signal is triggered when all of the following conditions are met:
- MACD > Signal line: The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence line (difference between the 12-day and 26-day Exponential Moving Averages/EMA) is above its 9-day EMA signal line, indicating positive momentum.

- RSI < 65: The Relative Strength Index is below 65, meaning the stock is not yet overbought and has room to grow.

- 10-day SMA > 50-day SMA: The 10-day Simple Moving Average is above the longer-term 50-day SMA, indicating an upward trend.

- Closing price > 10-day SMA: The current closing price is above the 10-day SMA, showing strength and confirming the recent positive momentum.

This version tracks 25 commonly-traded stocks to stay within free API limits of 25 hits per day, but future iterations will allow for rotating different stock symbols daily to further increase sample size. Future versions will also involve backtesting logic and indicator thresholds, to determine the most effective logic in assigning buy signals.

## Stock Buy Signal Average Return
Across all timeframes, the average return % is greater for those with buy signals:

## Stock Buy Signal Win Rate
Across all timeframes, win rate (% of investments with positive return) is greater for those with buy signals:

## Architecture

1. **Dockerized Environment**: The entire stack (Airflow, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and pipeline scripts) runs inside Docker containers using Docker Compose for easy, consistent setup.
2. **Kafka Producer**: Fetches daily stock data for a list of symbols from Alpha Vantage and publishes to a Kafka topic. Note the run_producer Airflow variable that can be used to skip producer step to avoid hitting API limits. Alpha Vantage allows 25 requests per day, so with 25 stocks in pipeline, producer can only be run 1x per day.
3. **Kafka Consumer**: Reads stock data from Kafka, stores it in PostgreSQL, and computes technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD, buy signals).
4. **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores raw stock data and calculated indicators for analysis and reporting.
5. **Airflow DAG**: Orchestrates running the producer, consumer, fetching results, running buy signnal effectiveness analysis, and emailing reports and visuals.
6. **Email Notification**: Sends a daily report with stock data and computed signals.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crowe32996/stock-market-buy-signals
cd stock-market-buy-signals
```

### 2. Configure Alpha Vantage API Key

- Get a free API key from Alpha Vantage

- Open dags/scripts/producer.py and replace the API_KEY value.


### 3. Build and start the Docker containers

This will:
- Start Kafka, Postgres, and Airflow (webserver + scheduler)

- Automatically create the stock_market_av database and stock_data table schema

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 4. Initialize Airflow (First Time Only)

Replace the following with your chosen credentials:

```bash
docker-compose run airflow-webserver db init

docker-compose run airflow-webserver users create --username admin --password admin --firstname Charlie --lastname Rowe --role Admin --email cwr321@gmail.com
```

### 5. Configure Airflow Variables (Optional)

The DAG uses an Airflow Variable `run_producer` to control whether the Kafka producer runs on each DAG execution.

- **Variable name:** `run_producer`
- **Type:** String (`true` or `false`)
- **Default behavior:** Automatically set to `"true"`, where the DAG updates the messages produced by the Alpha Vantage API.
- The API request limit is 25 requests per day, so set it to `"false"` if testing/re-running other tasks for the second time in a day and beyond. 

- In the Airflow UI, go to **Admin > Variables**, and create a new variable:
  - Key: `run_producer`
  - Value: `true`

- Or via Docker CLI (replace container name if different):

```bash
docker exec -it stock-market-buy-signals-airflow-webserver-1 airflow variables set run_producer true
```


### 6. Access the Airflow UI
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080, then log in with your new user credentials.

Trigger the DAG kafka_stock_pipeline. Each run will:
- Run the Kafka producer to fetch daily stock data

- Process and store the data in Postgres

- Generate indicators + buy signal

- Save results to CSV

- Email the stock summary (Update recipient email in dags/kafka_stock_dag.py)


## Data and Indicators
Indicators computed:

- SMA 10-day and 50-day

- RSI (Relative Strength Index)

- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

- Buy signal based on combined indicator logic

## Quick Analysis Summary
Included is a Python visualization of:

- Buy signal performance across multiple return horizons (1, 5, 10, 20, 30 days)

Metrics:

- Average return

- Win rate (percentage of positive returns)

Note: Sample sizes are currently small and results are preliminary. Data volume will grow over time as the pipeline runs daily.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand stock universe beyond initial 25 symbols and rotate stocks per day

- Improve buy signal logic and introduce multiple methodologies for comparison

- Add visual dashboards for live tracking of buy signal effectiveness

- Deploy Docker-based pipeline onto Kubernetes
